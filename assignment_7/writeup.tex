\section{Definition Of Problem}
This assignment is to create a queue of integers borrowing the list from our
previous assignment.

The queue must satisfy the following criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Provide for adding to a queue.
\item Provide for popping from a queue.
\item Provide a check for the empty condition.
\item Provide a check for the full condition.
\item Provide a Type-def for the data structures used to implement the queue.
\item Provide an initialization method to setup a queue.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Preliminary Analysis}

This basic implementation uses a linked list to implement the data portion of the implementation.
A linked list consists of a series of nodes and links describing the ordering of the nodes.
A node in a linked list is a structure that contains a data item and a pointer to the next node in the list.

The functions are also provided in with the data structure.

The menu for the user is in main.
